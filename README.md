## Hey , I'm Darya, a professional data analyst


I'm Darya, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 13 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SOL, and ML. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the media & communications sphere to drive growth and boost sales.
Currently, I am working with customer data to find ways of attracting more followers and increasing business metrics. My previous experience in SMM and years of collaborating with clients have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time management, and problem-solving skills.
In 2021, I enrolled in the TripleTen 10-month Data Analyst program. The curriculum covered Python (Pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup), data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau), machine learning (scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.
During my learning journey, I also participated in an externship program, where I completed a business task from the company Norbu, which teaches users how to manage their stress levels and emotions through a user-friendly mobile app. You can learn more about this and my other projects in my repositories!
